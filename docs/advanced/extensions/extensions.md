# Extensions

Extensions are a way to incorporate (or even eliminate) new features to the language via macros.
By definition only exist three types of extensions: 'superset', 'subset' and 'behavior'.

- Superset: Add new features to the language like new types, operators, keywords, etc.
- Subset: Opposite to 'superset', remove features from the language.
- Behavior: Don't add or remove features, but change the behavior of the language.

Currently there are two proposed extensions: 'GPU' and 'Reactive'.
