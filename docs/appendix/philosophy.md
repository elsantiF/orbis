# Philosophy

## About bugs

- Compiler errors are better than runtime bugs
- Rescues are better than panics
- Runtime crashes are better than undefined behavior

## About code

- The best code is the no code
- Readability over performance (without compromising efficiency when critical).
- Trust the compiler, it's smarter than you

## About languages

- Programming languages must adapt to developers, not the other way around
- Small and simple core, with a powerful standard library
- Easy to learn, challenging to master

## About performance

- Computers are getting faster, but not forever
- Compile time is an abundant resource; use it for optimization.
- Resources of the end user are limited

## About software development

- 80% of the work takes 20% of the time
- Edge cases need to be handled; they aren't optional
- Reusable code is better than single-use code
