# Layers

Like onions (or ogres), Orbis is separated into layers. Each layer is a different part of the language, and they are all connected to each other. The layers are:

- **Language**: The core of the language, where the syntax and semantics are defined.
- **Core**: A basic set of utilities and functions that are always available. You can disable them if you want.
- **Standard Library**: A set of modules that provide common functionality, like math, I/O, and collections.
- **Extensions**: Additional modules that provide more functionality. You can enable or disable them as you wish.

This separation allows you to have a minimal language if you want, or a full-featured one. You can also create your own modules and use them in your projects. \
It's important to know about the existence of these layers, because they can help you understand how the language works and how you can customize it.
