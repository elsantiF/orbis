# Comments

There will be two types of comments in the code:

```ts
// Single line comment and

/*
    Multi-line comment
*/
```

Multi-line comments can be used as documentation:

```ts
/*
    This function adds two numbers together.
    @param a The first number
    @param b The second number
    @return The sum of a and b
*/
fn add(a: i32, b: i32): i32 {
    a + b
}
```
